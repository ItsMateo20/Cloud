# ⬇ Downloading nessesary tools

## Windows

### Chocolatey - easiest way

{% hint style="info" %}
We really suggest downloading this, It speeds up the downloading of everything. But if this way dosen't work for you skip it (You will have to download ffmpeg somehow else tho)
{% endhint %}

* Download chocolatey from the offical page at [https://chocolatey.org/install#individual](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual)
* Open PowerShell as administrator and use the command`$`<mark style="color:yellow;">`choco`</mark>`install git nodejs ffmpeg`

### Node.js

* Download Nodejs from the offical page at [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en) and select the recommended install.

### Git

* Download Git from the offical page at [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### FFmpeg

* The best way of installing this is through Chocolatey using the command `$`<mark style="color:yellow;">`choco`</mark>`install ffmpeg` I don't know other way because they didn't work for me.

### 7-zip or WinRAR

* Download 7-Zip [https://7-zip.org/](https://7-zip.org/) or WinRAR [https://www.win-rar.com/start.html](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html) to unpack the zip that you will be downloading from [https://github.com/ItsMateo20/Cloud/releases/latest](https://github.com/ItsMateo20/Cloud/releases/latest) on future steps

## Linux and IOS not supported yet (I think, didn't test)
