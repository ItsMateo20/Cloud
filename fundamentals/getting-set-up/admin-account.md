# ðŸ‘¤ Admin account

## Whitelist and Admin privileges

Now that the server has started, you can log in to the admin account. This allows you to whitelist your email, grant yourself admin privileges, change the password of the admin account and view other users files when you turn on "Admin mode".

The login details for the admin account are as follows:

| Email           | Password |
| --------------- | -------- |
| admin@localhost | admin    |

After logging in, navigate to the "Admin menu" and then select "Whitelist Menu". Enter your email and click "Add". If you want your main account to have admin privileges, you can go to the "Admin menu" tab within the "Admin menu" dropdown, enter your email, and click "Add".

## Admin Mode

Navigate to the profile button at the far right of the navigation bar and left-click (mouse1) on it. Then, press "Admin Mode". The page will refresh, and you will be able to see everybody's files. You can rename, delete, download, and perform every action you would if it were your folder.
